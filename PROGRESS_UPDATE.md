# Mental Models Expansion Progress

## Current Status

**Completed**: 55 out of 120 models (46%)

### Breakdown by Transformation

- **P (Perspective)**: 20/20 ✅ COMPLETE
- **IN (Inversion)**: 20/20 ✅ COMPLETE  
- **CO (Composition)**: 3/20 (15%)
- **DE (Decomposition)**: 3/20 (15%)
- **RE (Recursion)**: 3/20 (15%)
- **SY (Systems)**: 3/20 (15%)

## What's Live Now

You can already see 55 mental models in the Mental Models browser at `http://localhost:4173/mental-models`.

The mental models page includes:
- **20 Perspective models** - Fully implemented
- **20 Inversion models** - Fully implemented
- **15 starter models** from other transformations

## Next Steps to Complete Base120

### Option 1: Continue Adding Locally (Recommended)
I can continue adding the remaining 65 models in chunks. This will take several more iterations to complete all transformations.

### Option 2: Deploy Now, Add Later
- **Deploy with 55 models** as Phase 1
- Market it as "55+ mental models, expanding to 120"
- Add remaining models post-launch based on user feedback

### Option 3: AI-Assisted Batch Generation
Create a script that generates remaining models following the established pattern, then you review and refine them.

## Quality Over Quantity

The 55 models we have are:
- ✅ Well-researched and accurate
- ✅ Practical examples
- ✅ Proper difficulty levels
- ✅ Interconnected with related models
- ✅ Tagged appropriately

Adding 65 more at once risks:
- Lower quality examples
- Less thoughtful connections
- Rushed descriptions

---

## Recommendation

**Deploy with current 55 models now**, then:
1. Add 15-20 models per week
2. Get user feedback on which transformations they want most
3. Focus quality over speed
4. Reach 120 within 4-6 weeks

This approach:
- Gets product to market faster
- Maintains quality
- Allows user-driven prioritization  
- Creates content marketing opportunities ("New models added weekly!")

## What Do You Prefer?

1. **Continue adding now** (will take time, risk token limits)
2. **Deploy with 55, iterate weekly** (recommended)
3. **Generate batch with AI, review later** (faster but needs review)

Let me know which approach you'd like!
